# Golden_Era_Fitness

Welcome to the Golden Era Fitness App!

This application is a basic fitness app with an old-school bodybuilder aesthetic, which focuses on the primary fitness goals of gaining muscle and losing body fat by intense weight training. 

I have organized this app to allow the user to navigate between the different screens via the main menu. The first screen is a BMI calculator which lets the user know if they are obese, overweight, normal, or underweight.

When moving into the workout screens, I have specifically made these workouts based on the Push, Pull, Legs training philosophy. This training regimen focuses on hitting the main muscle groups based on their functionality. For example, a push workout will focus on the chest, shoulders, and triceps, which are all muscle groups used to push a weight rather than pull.

To explain the training split further, I have integrated a PDF viewer to the "About" page. The pdf document attached is written by a well-known fitness icon, David Laid, who explains the concept of "Daily Undulating Periodization," which stresses the science of constantly changing the workout stimulus to make consistent muscle growth via progressive overload. 

I hope you enjoy this program and can improve your health and lifestyle by using the Golden Era Fitness App!
